# ReportApplication

I use this application for my work. I tried to fill it with a lot of features for my self, that make my job perfomance more comfortable. It is my first serious project om WPF, earlier i use only WinForms. In this project i learned how make my own styles of wpf component, how to bind some data(_but of course not ideal_) and i`ve made my own component. Also I tried to implement pattern builder.

It is 0.1 alpha version, because It needs to implement car page, where I will be able to see listview of cars.
